# [App Data Analysis](https://github.com/Tj-dev-py/Data_Science_Repository/blob/main/App%20Data%20Analysis%20.ipynb)
This is a project that involves looking through apps in the google play market and the App store in Apple. We put ourselves in the role of a Data Analyst working in a company that develops apps that are free to download and install. We are tasked with finding what kind of apps have the most ratings and are generally well-liked by people and transfer that knowledge to the developers.
